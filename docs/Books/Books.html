					<h4>Here is a list of my favorite books of all time:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><i>The Color Purple</i></li><p> - I read this book during summer break as a teen and it single-handedly taught me the power of books. Reading this book simultaneously made me feel seen and feel the weight of the protag's emotions. The confidence, power, and self-worth she gained through her experiences and women she encountered made her transformation all the more special. The power I felt from this novel as an adolescent sticks with me in my adulthood.</p>
						<li><i>A Tale for the Time Being</i></li><p> - This one is a more recent read. I had taken a break from reading after dropping some awful book, and I am so happy I took the leap in picking this one up. I love the way this book presents Zen Buddhist principles. It has encouraged me to look at everything differently and has sparked an interest in Zen. The time I started reading was crucial as well, since I'm only four months past my hospitalization and the content deals with the topic of suicide quite heavily. I will admit, there were a few moments that were triggering, but overall the experience challenged me to introduce concepts relating to philosophy into my daily mindset. I can tell this is a read that will stick with me for a long time.</p>
						<li><i>Animal Farm</i></li><p> - I read this during a summer break as well. This book stands out to me not because it was an emotional piece of literature like my other favorites, but because it was so uniquely real and unreal. This wasn't emotional at all, in fact it was straight up hilarious yet frighteningly bleak in the narrative's inspiration from the Russian Revolution. It was a wonderful, entertaining satire that invites the reader to question how easy it is for liberty to be discarded and redefined to suit the needs of power hungry individuals. Just thinking about it makes me wanna read it again.</p>
