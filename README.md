I made this website to hold all the little things I love and to compile whatever information I could find about them from the internet, 
books, or lived experience. This is meant to be a personal project, and is a way for me to practice web design. I'm new to this, so any 
suggestions you can offer on HTML, CSS, or Java would be appreciated.
